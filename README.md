# swiss-round-pairing-blossom
A swiss-round pairing code based on "Blossom" method

To use it, open swiss_round.php from your browser, and add players number and rounds number, for example
>swiss_round.php?players=15&rounds=4

If you only write swiss_round.php or you omit one of the parameters, the code will use the default settings for the omitted value, which are 15 players and 6 rounds of swiss
